I need a python program that will read a markdown text file and produce a CSV file. The first column of the CSV file will contain the words that appear after "####" in the markdown file. The column heading for this column will be "Language". The second column, titled "grapheme" will contain the characters from the string that appears in next markdown file line after the ####. That string needs to be split into multiple spreadsheet rows, splitting on the space character. So each line of the spreadsheet will have language in column one and one grapheme from the language in column two.
